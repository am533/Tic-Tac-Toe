# Tic-Tac-Toe
Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game which includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Javafx. Features include single-player mode where you play against an AI computer player, multi-player mode where you play against your friend, score tracking, and the ability to assign symbols and the order of turns. The computer player has an algorithm designed to always tie with or beat the user.
## Game Features
* Single-player mode: play against the computer
* Multi-player mode: play against a friend on the same device
* Game symbols: players can select either X or O symbols
* User first: if it’s a multi-player game, the user can choose whether or not they want to go first or not
* Graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX
* Score tracking for both players
## Getting Started
TODO: give instructions to download and setup game to play,
## How To Play
* Run the GUI.java file
* Once the game is launched, you will be presented with the home screen.
* On the home screen, you will be prompted to select a game mode. You can choose between single-player or multi-player mode.
* If you select single-player mode, you will be prompted to select the symbol (X or O) you want to play with and whether or not you want to make the first move.
* If you select multi-player mode, both players will be prompted to select their symbols and the order of play.
* Once you have made your selections and hit the "Next" button, the game board will be displayed. If one or more of the prompts isn’t filled, an error message will display, telling you which fields you need to fill out.
* In single-player mode, the computer will make its move after you make yours, and will make the first move if you choose to not go first. In multi-player mode, it is up to you and your opponent to take turns making moves.
* To make a move, simply click on the desired tile on the game board. The tile will be marked with your symbol (X or O).
* The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
* If a player wins, a message will be displayed on the screen and their score will be incremented.
* You can play again by hitting the "Play Again" button, or return to the home screen by hitting the "Home" button.
